# Hello, I'm beProsto :D
## A wanna-be game engine dev and occasional game dev
- My best projects:
	- [WebXR Tutorial](https://beprosto.github.io/webxr-tutorial) - A simple, brief WebXR for VR tutorial.
	- [OWL](https://github.com/beProsto/OWL) - Open Windowing Library is a multiplatform library for creating windows, managing them and event handling within them.
	- [ORE](https://github.com/beProsto/ORE) - Open Rendering Engine is an open-source easy to use graphics renderer, made for 2D purposes.
	- [C C++ WASM Compilation](https://github.com/beProsto/C-CPP-WASM-Compilation) - It's a project that tests out clang's capabilities at compiling c and c++ code to wasm and communication with javascript.
	- [simplechat amogus](https://github.com/beProsto/simplechat-amogus) - A simple 3D multiplayer game for the web browser, inspired by Among Us - moreso the memes that stemmed from it. Used this project as means of learning about WebRTC as a way to get UDP communication on the web browser.
	- [tik tak toe](https://github.com/beProsto/tiktaktoe) - A very simple tic tac toe game, played on a 10x10 grid, needing 5 signs in a row to win. Inspired by the tic tac toe minigame from Machinarium. Used this project as means of learning more about the Go programming language.
